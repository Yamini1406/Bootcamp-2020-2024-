1) For a stack of size N, s[N-1] will return the top of stack
2) The postfix form of the expression (A+ B)*(C*D- E)*F / G is : AB + CD* E - *F *G /
3) Which one of the following is an application of Stack Data Structure?
      Managing function calls
      The stock span problem
      Arithmetic expression evaluation
  ans)All of the above
  
4) Which of the following is the top pointer variable of the stack in it's linked representation? Start pointer
5) The prefix form of an infix expression p + q - r * t is : - +pq * rt




NOTE
----

Infix to Postfix: 
Same preference: first one will go out
Ex: +* --> when (-) is inserted * with higher precedence is popped first and then +-, first (+) was there, so + is popped.
Ex: +** --> +*

prefix evaluation:

from last to first
Expression: + 5 * 4 6  --->  6 4 ,*,24 5,+,29:ans
